Description: Fit flexible occupancy models in Stan via brms. Flocker brings 
   the full variety of brms effects structures to the relevant distributional 
   terms in multiple classes of occupancy model, including standard 
   single-season models, models with data augmentation for never-observed 
   species, dynamic (multiseason) models with explicit colonization and 
   extinction processes, and dynamic models with autologistic occupancy 
   dynamics. Depending on the model class, flocker can specify formulas for any 
   of occupancy, detection, colonization, extinction, and/or the autologistic 
   term.
