`flocker` is an R package for fitting [occupancy models](https://jsocolar.github.io/closureOccupancy/) that incorportate 
sophisticated effects structures using simple formula-based syntax. `flocker` is 
built on R package `brms`, which in turn is a front-end for `Stan`. 

This vignette is intended as a companion to [Socolar & Mills 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564080v1),
where we provide details of the models and post-processing functionality 
available in `flocker` in greater detail. Here, we provide illustrative R code 
for several types of model, demonstrating data simulation, model fitting, 
and model post-processing. We also showcase the `brms` syntax 
that `flocker` can use to fit a variety of sophisticated effect 
structures.

## Terms and definitions
Socolar & Mills (2023) introduce several terms that figure importantly in this 
vignette, including:

* **closure-unit**: The groupings of observations over which
 [closure](https://jsocolar.github.io/closureOccupancy/) is assumed. In 
 single-species models, a closure-unit corresponds to a "site" or "point". In 
 multi-species models, a closure-unit is a species-site combination. In dynamic
 (multi-season) models, a closure-unit is a site-season combination (or 
 species-site-season in a multi-species dynamic model).
 
* **rep-constant**, **rep-varying**: We refer to models that assume constant
 detection probabilities across repeat visits within closure-units as 
 *rep-constant models*, as contrasted with *rep-varying models* that incorporate
 event-specific detection covariates. It turns out that rep-constant models 
 enable a more efficient parametrization of the likelihood than rep-varying models.

* **unit covariates**, **event covariates**: We refer to any covariate that does
 not vary across sampling events within closure-units as a "unit covariate". 
 This includes covariates that are intrinsically properties of single 
 closure-units (e.g. the elevations of sites in a single-species model), 
 covariates that are intrinsically properties of groups of closure units (e.g. 
 elevations of sites in a multi-species model), and covariates that are 
 intrinsically properties of sampling events but happen to be constant within
 all closure-units (e.g. observer in a sampling design where every site is 
 visited by exactly one observer). We refer to any covariate that varies across 
 sampling events within covariates as an "event covariate". Note that while unit 
 covariates may appear in either the occupancy or the detection formula, event 
 covariates are restricted to the detection formula. Models that incorporate 
 event covariates are *rep-varying* (see above); those that do not are 
 *rep-constant*.

## Installation and feedback
[Installation instructions are available here](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/). 
To request features or report bugs (much appreciated!), please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jsocolar/flocker/issues).

To make `flocker` and `brms` functions globally available within an R session 
run:
```{r library, message = FALSE}
library(flocker)
library(brms)
set.seed(1)
```

## Data simulation
General purpose data simulation is provided via `simulate_flocker_data()`, which
by default will simulate a dataset with 30 species sampled at 50 sites using 
four replicate surveys (i.e. a single-season multi-species dataset). Non-default
arguments will simulate example data for other likelihoods, including 
multi-season and data-augmented occupancy models. 

```{r simulate}
d <- simulate_flocker_data()
```

The simulated data `d` are in list form, with elements for the 
detection/non-detection observations `d$obs`, unit covariates 
`d$unit_covs`, and event covariates `d$event_covs`. 
`d$obs` is a matrix where rows are species-site combinations, 
columns are replicate visits, and entries are `1` (detection), `0` 
(nondetection), or `NA` (no visit). `d$unit_covs` is a dataframe 
containing covariates that vary across the rows of obs (i.e. by closure-unit) 
but not across the columns within any given row (i.e. do not vary across 
replicate visits). `event_covs` is a named list of matrices, with each matrix 
having the same dimensions as the observation matrix. Each list element 
corresponds to a covariate that varies across the columns of `d$obs` (i.e. 
varies between replicate visits). 

## Data formatting
`flock()`, the main function in `flocker` for fitting occupancy models, 
expects a highly specific data format that we [describe more fully here](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/flocker_format.html). The function `make_flocker_data()` 
formats data for use with `flock()` automatically. For single-season models,
`make_flocker_data()` takes as input a matrix or dataframe of 
detection/non-detection data. Rows represent closure-units, columns represent 
repeated sampling events within closure-units, and entries must be `0` 
(nondetection), `1` (detection), or `NA` (no corresponding sampling event). The 
data must be formatted so that all `NA`s are trailing within their rows. For 
example, if some units were sampled four times and other three times, the three 
sampling events must be treated as events 1, 2, and 3 (with the fourth event 
`NA`) rather than as events 1, 3, and 4 (with the second event `NA`) or any 
other combination.

Many occupancy models also include covariates that influence occupancy or 
detection probabilities. Unit covariates (see [Terms and definitions]) can 
be passed to `make_flocker_data()` as a dataframe with the same number of rows 
as the observation matrix and data in the same order as the rows of the 
observation matrix. Columns are covariates, and we recommend using informative 
column names. *Event covariates* (see [Terms and definitions]) can be 
passed as a named list of matrices whose elements `[i, j]` are the covariate 
values for the sampling event represented by the corresponding position of the 
observation matrix. Again, we recommend using informative names for the list 
elements. If the corresponding observation is `NA`, then the value of the event 
covariate does not matter.

To pass data to `flocker`, we first pass the output from 
`simulate_flocker_data()` to `make_flocker_data()`, which will repackage data 
and apply the necessary formatting: 

```{r format}
fd_rep_varying <- make_flocker_data(
  obs = d$obs, 
  unit_covs = d$unit_covs, 
  event_covs = d$event_covs
  )
```

The function `make_flocker_data()` outputs an object of class `flocker_data` 
that we can pass to flocker's model fitting function `flock()`. Note that this 
is the general workflow users will need to follow with real data. Alternative 
inputs to `make_flocker_data()` and `flock()` enable the user to readily fit 
multi-season models as well as multi-species models with data augmentation
(see below).

## Model fitting
### The single-season rep-varying model
To fit a model, in this case a single-season multi-species occupancy model, we 
use the function `flock()`. By supplying different arguments to this function, 
all flavors of occupancy model available in `flocker` can be fitted. Formulas
for the different distributional parameters in the model (occupancy, detection,
colonization, extinction, and autologistic terms as applicable) are provided
as one-sided formulas to the relevant arguments of `flock()` (`f_occ`, `f_det`, 
`f_col`, `f_ex`, and `f_auto` as applicable).

```{r rep-varying}
rep_varying <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1 + (1 + uc1 + ec1 | species),
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying,
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
```

Arguments supplied to `flock()` define formulas using `brms` syntax for the 
occupancy (`f_occ`) and detection (`f_det`) components, and also provide the 
formatted data. At this stage, the full flexibility and power of `brms` formula 
syntax are available to the user (see following sections for some examples).
`rep_varying` is a `brmsfit` object from package `brms` and also a `flockerfit` 
object from package `flocker`. Post-processing functions from `brms` will 
typically not work with this object and are instead replaced by `flocker` 
equivalents.

### The single-season rep-constant model
`make_flocker_data()` will automatically format the data for a rep-constant 
model when `event_covs = NULL` and the desired model is a single-season model 
without data augmentation. To take advantage of the efficiency gains and 
post-processing functionality of the rep-constant model, it is necessary to 
supply `event_covs = NULL` to `make_flocker_data()` at the moment of data 
formatting; it is insufficient to omit event covariates from the detection 
formula supplied to `flock()` after formatting the data for a rep-varying model.

```{r rep-constant}
fd_rep_constant <- make_flocker_data(
  obs = d$obs, 
  unit_covs = d$unit_covs
  )
rep_constant <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  f_det = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  flocker_data = fd_rep_constant,
  save_pars = save_pars(all = TRUE), # for loo with moment matching
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0,
  cores = 4
  )
```

Note that within-chain parallelization is available (uniquely so) for the 
rep-constant mode:
```{r rep-constant-parallel, eval = FALSE}
rep_constant <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  f_det = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  flocker_data = fd_rep_constant,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0,
  chains = 2,
  cores = 2,
  threads = 2
  )
```

### Multi-season models
Here we provide code examples to complement the [companion publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564080v1).
For a more complete vignette on multi-season models in `flocker`, see the [multiseason models vignette](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/multiseason_models.html).

First, we simulate some data that are valid for use with multi-season models. 
Here, we will simulate data for three seasons with one unit covariate and one 
event covariate. The data will be simulated under a colonization-extinction 
model with explicit inits, but we will be able to fit other models 
(autologistic, equilibrium inits) to the same data (note that 
`simulate_flocker_data()` can also simulate directly from these other model 
types).

```{r multiseason-data}
multi_data <- simulate_flocker_data(
  n_season = 3,
  n_pt = 300,
  n_sp = 1,
  multiseason = "colex", 
  multi_init = "explicit",
  seed = 1
  )

fd_multi <- make_flocker_data(
  multi_data$obs, 
  multi_data$unit_covs, 
  multi_data$event_covs, 
  type = "multi",
  quiet = TRUE
  )
```

Below, we fit the colonization-extinction model with an explicit model for 
occupancy in the first timestep. Depending on hardware, fitting this model might 
take several minutes.

```{r multi-colex}
multi_colex <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1,
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1,
  f_col = ~ uc1,
  f_ex = ~ uc1,
  flocker_data = fd_multi,
  multiseason = "colex",
  multi_init = "explicit",
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
)
```

Here is the colonization-extinction model using equilibrium occupancy 
probabilities in the first timestep:

```{r multi-colex-eq}
multi_colex_eq <- flock(
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1,
  f_col = ~ uc1,
  f_ex = ~ uc1,
  flocker_data = fd_multi,
  multiseason = "colex",
  multi_init = "equilibrium",
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
```

Here is the autologistic model with explicit occupancy probabilities in the 
first timestep. To reflect the stereotypical autologistic model with a constant 
logit-scale offset separating colonization and persistence probabilities, we use 
the formula `f_auto = ~ 1`, but it is fine to relax this constraint and use, 
e.g. `f_auto = ~ uc1`.

```{r multi-auto}
multi_auto <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1,
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1,
  f_col = ~ uc1,
  f_auto = ~ 1,
  flocker_data = fd_multi,
  multiseason = "autologistic",
  multi_init = "explicit",
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
```

And the autologistic model with equilibrium occupancy probabilities in the 
first timestep:

```{r multi-auto-eq}
multi_auto_eq <- flock(
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1,
  f_col = ~ uc1,
  f_auto = ~ 1,
  flocker_data = fd_multi,
  multiseason = "autologistic",
  multi_init = "equilibrium",
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
)
```

### Data-augmented multi-species models
Here we provide a simple example of code for a data augmented model.
For a more complete unified vignette on data-augmented models in `flocker`, see
the [data-augmented models vignette](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/augmented_models.html).

Fitting the data-augmented model in `flocker` requires passing the observed 
data as a three-dimensional array with sites along the first dimension, visits 
along the second, and species along the third. Additionally, we must supply the 
`n_aug` argument to `make_flocker_data()`, specifying how many all-zero 
pseudospecies to augment the data with.

```{r data-augmented}
augmented_data <- simulate_flocker_data(
    augmented = TRUE
    )
fd_augmented <- make_flocker_data(
  augmented_data$obs, augmented_data$unit_covs, augmented_data$event_covs,
  type = "augmented", n_aug = 100,
  quiet = TRUE
  )
augmented <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ (1 | ff_species),
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1 + (1 + uc1 + ec1 | ff_species),
  augmented = TRUE,
  flocker_data = fd_augmented,
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
```

Here, the random effect of species is specified using the special grouping 
keyword `ff_species` (names beginning with `ff_` are reserved in `flocker` and 
are not allowed as names for user-supplied covariates).

## Post-processing
`flocker` provides functions for four main types of bespoke post-processing
for occupancy models. `fitted_flocker()` computes (and optionally summarizes) 
posterior distributions of fitted values at the locations of the data
used in model fitting or of new data. `get_Z()` provides the posterior distribution for the 
latent occupancy state. `predict_flocker()` provides posterior predictions at 
the observed points (e.g. for use in posterior predictive checking) or for new 
data. `loo_flocker()` and `loo_compare_flocker()` both provide functionality for 
model comparison. See below for details on all four types of post-processing. 
Both posterior predictions and model comparison rely on subtle aspects of the 
occupancy model likelihood that we explain in more detail [here](https://jsocolar.github.io/likelihoodOccupancy/).

### brms-native post-processing
All post-processing functions from `brms` work on single-season rep-constant
models, but do not work on any other model types. For example:

```{r rep-constant-processing, eval = FALSE}
predictions_rep_constant <- brms::posterior_predict(rep_constant)
loo_rep_constant <- brms::loo(rep_constant, moment_match = TRUE)
brms::conditional_effects(rep_constant)
```

The following functions work on all model types available in `flocker`.

### Fitted values
Fitted values for any of the distributional parameter (one or more of occupancy,
detection, colonization, extinction, autologistic, and/or Omega, the fitted 
probability that a given (pseudo)species occurs in the metacommunity) are
available via `fitted_flocker`. For example:

```{r fitted-flocker, eval = FALSE}
fitted_flocker(rep_constant)
fitted_flocker(rep_varying)
fitted_flocker(multi_colex)
fitted_flocker(augmented)
```

`fitted_flocker` provides a replacement for
`brms::posterior_linpred()`. While the `brms`-native function executes on
any `flocker` model, it returns in an opaque shape related to
[the flocker data format](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/flocker_format.html). `fitted_flocker()` returns in the shape of the observations passed
to `make_flocker_data()`, with posterior iterations stacked along its final 
dimension.

### The posterior occupancy state
The function `get_Z()` returns the posterior distribution of occupancy probabilities across the closure-units. The shape of the output depends on the class of model, and is an array in the shape of the first visit in `obs` as passed to `make_flocker_data`, with posterior iterations stacked along the final dimension. Thus, for a single-season rep-varying model, the output is a matrix where rows are posterior iterations, columns are closure-units, and values are draws from the posterior distribution of occupancy probabilities:

```{r get_Z, eval=FALSE}
get_Z(rep_varying)
```

For all model types, `get_Z()` accepts an optional `new_data` argument. Leaving 
the default `new_data = NULL` supplies the posterior for the true occupancy state 
at the locations of the data used to fit the model. Otherwise, the posterior is 
computed over the new data. For single-season models, `new_data` can be supplied 
as a dataframe of unit covariate values or as a `flocker_data` object. For 
multi-season models, only a `flocker_data` object is allowed. Note that if 
predictions are desired at sites without observations, it is acceptable to pass 
an array of dummy observations (e.g. all zeros) to `make_flocker_data()` and 
then to set `history_condition = FALSE` in the call to `get_Z()`.

`get_Z()` accepts several additional arguments that control the way that posterior is obtained and the values returned. See the [companion paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564080v1) and 
`?get_Z` for details.

### Posterior prediction
The function `predict_flocker()` provides posterior predictions. By default, 
predictions are provided for the covariate data to which the model were fit, but predictions to new data are also possible via the `new_data` argument. The 
output differs by model type. For single-season rep-constant models, the return 
is a matrix where rows are iterations, columns are units, and values are the 
number of detections. For single-season rep-varying models, the return is an 
array whose first dimension is units, second dimension is sampling events, 
third dimension is iterations, and values are `1`, `0`, or `NA`, representing 
detection, nondetection, and no corresponding sampling event. For example:

```{r predict_flocker, eval=FALSE}
predict_flocker(rep_varying)
```

`predict_flocker()` accepts several additional arguments that control the way 
that posterior is obtained and the values of returned. See the [companion paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564080v1) and `?predict_flocker` for details.

### Model comparison
The most straightforward way to compare models fit with `flocker` is the 
function `loo_compare_flocker()`. This function takes a list of flocker_fit 
objects as its argument and returns a model comparison table based on the 
difference in the expected log predictive density (elpd) between models. This 
table is a `compare.loo` object from `loo::loo_compare()`. The "leave-one-out" 
holdouts consist of entire closure-units (single-season models), series 
(multi-season models), or species (augmented models), not single sampling events 
(see the [companion paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564080v1) and [here](https://jsocolar.github.io/likelihoodOccupancy/) for details of why). 

`loo_compare_flocker()` accepts as input a list of `flockerfit` objects 
and outputs a model comparison table. For example, we can compare the 
rep-constant and rep-varying models that we fit to the same initial data. Recall
that the data were simulated with event-covariate effects on detection, and as
expected the rep-varying model performs best. Note that we ensure that these
comparisons between rep-constant and rep-varying models are valid by omitting
the binomial coefficient when computing the log-likelihood for the rep-constant
model.

```{r}
loo_compare_flocker(
  list(rep_constant, rep_varying)
)
```

Likewise, we can compare the four flavors of multi-season model that we fit 
above. Recall that the data were simulated under colonization-extinction 
dynamics (rather than autologistic) and under explicit initial occupancy 
probabilities (rather than equilibrium). As expected, the `multi_colex` model 
performs best:

```{r multi-season-loo}
loo_compare_flocker(
  list(multi_colex, multi_colex_eq, multi_auto, multi_auto_eq)
)
```

Flocker also provides the function `loo_flocker()` to return a table of 
`elpd_loo`, `p_loo`, and `looic` estimates from `loo::loo()` or `brms::loo()` 
(the latter for single-season rep-constant models only). 

## `brms` tips and tricks
Mastering advanced occupancy modeling via `flocker` is mostly a matter of 
mastering the syntax available in `brms`. Here are some useful pieces of syntax:

### Priors
Priors can be implemented as they would with any `brms` model. Priors can be 
specified using `set_prior()`, with priors specified for groups of parameters 
(via `class`) or individual parameters (via `coef`). The priors used for a 
particular model can be retrieved using `brms::prior_summary()`, and the 
names of the parameters and their default priors can be displayed prior to 
model fitting using `get_flocker_prior()` which is a drop-in replacement for 
`brms::get_prior()`.

```{r prior-summary}
get_flocker_prior(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species),
  f_det = ~ uc1 + ec1 + (1 + uc1 + ec1 | species),
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying
  )
brms::prior_summary(rep_varying)
```

Note that in examples like the above, with covariates shared between both the occupancy and detection model formulas (`uc1` in this example), then the prior table will contain two entries 
associated with the covariate, one for the parameter governing occupancy and 
one for the parameter governing detection. Specifying priors for parameters in formulas 
other than detection can be done with reference to the `dpar` column, e.g.:

```{r, priors_3, eval=FALSE}
user_prior <- c(brms::set_prior("normal(0, 1)", coef = "uc1"), 
                brms::set_prior("normal(0, 3)", coef = "uc1", dpar = "occ"))
```
where the `uc1` parameter in the occupancy component is specified by the 
addition of the `dpar` argument, and the `uc1` parameter in the detection 
component is specified without reference to `dpar`.

For more on priors in `brms`, see `?brms::set_prior`.

Users should understand the implications of the default `brms` behavior to 
internally center the design matrix, which affects how the prior on the intercept 
gets set (see `?brms::set_prior`). Here is an example, based on a 
single-season rep-varying model, wherein we set a logistic prior on the value of 
the intercepts (flat on the probability scale) when all predictors are held at 
their means and a moderately regularizing prior on the coefficients:

```{r priors1}
rep_varying_prior1 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1,
  f_det = ~ ec1,
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying,
  prior = 
    brms::set_prior("logistic(0,1)", class = "Intercept") +
    brms::set_prior("logistic(0,1)", class = "Intercept", dpar = "occ") +
    brms::set_prior("normal(0,2)", class = "b") +
    brms::set_prior("normal(0,2)", class = "b", dpar = "occ"),
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
brms::prior_summary(rep_varying_prior1)
```

Here is an example where we set informative priors on the intercepts when all covariates are fixed to zero and the same moderately regularizing prior on the coefficients:

```{r priors2}
rep_varying_prior2 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ 0 + Intercept + uc1,
  f_det = ~ 0 + Intercept + ec1,
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying,
  prior = 
    brms::set_prior("normal(0,2)", class = "b") +
    brms::set_prior("normal(0,2)", class = "b", dpar = "occ") +
    brms::set_prior("normal(1, 1)", class = "b", coef = "Intercept") +
    brms::set_prior("normal(-1, 1)", class = "b", coef = "Intercept", dpar = "occ"),
  cores = 4,
  silent = 2,
  refresh = 0
  )
brms::prior_summary(rep_varying_prior2)
```

### Model formulas
Simple formulas follow the same syntax as R's `lm()` function. For example: 
```{r lm, eval=FALSE}
mod1 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1|species), 
  f_det = ~ 1, 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_constant
  )
```

### Random effects
Simple random effects follow `lme4` syntax, including advanced `lme4` syntax 
like `||` for uncorrelated effects and `/` and `:` for expansion of multiple 
grouping terms. Here's a simple example:
```{r lme4, eval=FALSE}
mod2 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1|species), 
  f_det = ~ 1, 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_constant
  )
```

When a model includes multiple random effects with the same grouping term, by 
default they are modeled as correlated *within* the occupancy or detection 
formulas, but as uncorrelated *between* formulas. For example, the code below 
estimates a single correlation for the intercept and slope in the occupancy 
sub-model.
```{r lme4_2, eval=FALSE}
mod3 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species), 
  f_det = ~ ec1 + (1 | species), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying
  )
```
However, this assumption can easily be relaxed using the `|<ID>|` syntax from 
`brms`. The `<ID>` is an arbitrary character string representing a group of 
terms to model as correlated. The below code, for example, models correlated 
intercepts in the occupancy and detection sub-models, and correlated effects of 
`sc1` on occupancy and `vc1` on detection, but no correlations between the 
intercepts and the slopes in either sub-model:
```{r lme4_3, eval=FALSE}
mod4 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 |g1| species) + (0 + uc1 |g2| species), 
  f_det = ~ ec1 + (1 |g1| species) + (0 + ec1 |g2| species), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying
  )
```
For more on `brms` syntax for random effects syntax, see the [documentation here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-017/index.html).

### Nonlinear models
Via `brms`, `flocker` supports Gaussian processes of arbitrary dimensionality
(`brms::gp()`) as well as `mgcv` syntax for thin-plate regression splines 
(`brms::s()`) and tensor product smooths (`brms::t2()`), and `brms` syntax for
monotonic effects of ordinal factors via `brms::mo()` ([see here](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_monotonic.html)). For 
example:
```{r spline-gp, eval=FALSE}
mod5 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ s(uc1), 
  f_det = ~ t2(uc1, ec1), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying
  )

mod6 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ 1, 
  f_det = ~ gp(uc1, ec1), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying
  )
```

In addition, `brms` provides the ability to estimate models wherein the 
predictors (e.g. for occupancy and detection) are parametric nonlinear functions 
whose parameters have their own covariate-based linear predictors. For more 
details and an example, see the [nonlinear models vignette](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/nonlinear_models.html). 

### Phylogenetic models
Phylogenetic effects can be included by providing a covariance matrix as a 
`data2` argument and using the `brms::gr()` function to link species identities 
in `flocker_data` with the supplied covariance matrix. Note that phylogenetic 
effects can be included in either the occupancy component, the detection 
component, or both! In our experience, it can be computationally tractable to 
include multiple phylogenetic effects within a single occupancy model (see 
[Mills et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3867)).

```{r, phylo, eval=FALSE} 
# simulate an example phylogeny
phylogeny <- ape::rtree(30, tip.label = paste0("sp_", 1:30))

# calculate covariance matrix
A <- ape::vcv.phylo(phylogeny)

mod8 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ 1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
  f_det = ~  1 + ec1 + (1|species), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying, 
  data2 = list(A = A)
  )

mod9 <- flock(
  f_occ = ~ 1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
  f_det = ~  1 + ec1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
  flocker_data = fd_rep_varying, 
  data2 = list(A = A)
  )
```

### Spatial and autoregressive structures
In addition to spatial Gaussian processes, `brms` provides a variety of 
autoregressive structures, both one-dimensional (see `brms::ar()`, 
`brms::arma()`) and two-dimensional (see `brms::car()`, `brms::sar()`. [See here](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/reference/car.html) for details about conditional autoregressive (CAR) models in `brms`, and note that `flock()` 
accepts a `data2` argument that it can pass to `brms` as necessary.

Our principle caution for users is that these autoregressive structures might 
lead to degenerate models when applied at the visit level (in detection 
formulas) or at the closure-unit level (in occupancy, colonization, extinction, 
or autologistic formulas) because observation-level random effects are often 
degenerate in regressions with Bernoulli responses. Thus we recommend applying
autoregressive terms to groupings of multiple visits (detection formula) or 
multiple closure-units (other formulas). However, we note that `flocker` *does* 
provide a well-identified one-dimensional first-order autoregressive structure 
for occupancy across closure-units in a single-season model. This is achieved by 
co-opting the autologistic parameterization of the multi-season model and 
applying it instead to closure-units arranged along a one-dimensional spatial 
transect, yielding a one-dimensional analog of a spatial autologistic occupancy 
model.

A second caution is to remind users that in multi-species models, users will 
likely want to fit separate spatial terms by species ([Doser et al 2022](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13897)). 
For Gaussian processes, this can be achieved via the `by` argument to 
`brms::gp()`. For some conditional autoregressive structures (those that allow 
disconnected islands), this can be achieved by passing a block-diagonal 
adjacency matrix wherein species are disconnected components.

We note that gaussian process priors for spatially varying coefficients are 
readily achieved via the nonlinear formula syntax of `brms`, though they may require large volumes of data to successfully fit. For more 
details and an example, see the [nonlinear models vignette](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/nonlinear_models.html).

### Measurement error in covariates
[See here](http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/reference/me.html) for relevant 
`brms` documentation.

## Additional fitting arguments
`flock` will pass any relevant parameters forward to `brms::brm()`, giving the 
user important control over the algorithmic details of how the model is fit. See
`?brms::brm` for details. To speed up the execution, we recommend supplying the 
argument `backend = "cmdstanr"`. This requires the `cmdstanr` package and a 
working installation of `cmdstan`; [see here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for 
instructions to get started and further details.
