<p>Multiseason occupancy models, also called dynamic occupancy models,
are models that assume <a href="https://jsocolar.github.io/closureOccupancy/" class="external-link">closure</a> over
units that are linked by explicit colonization and extinction
processes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, sites are surveyed over a series
of more than one timestep,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> closure is assumed to hold within (but not
across) timesteps, and the latent occupancy state is linked across
timesteps within a site via models of local colonization and extinction
processes. Following the terminology introduced <a href="https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/flocker_tutorial.html" class="external-link">here</a>,
we will refer to the units over which closure is assumed as
<em>closure-units</em> or just plain <em>units</em>. Groups of units
that are linked by colonization-extinction dynamics (i.e. units
representing different timesteps within a site) are <em>series</em>.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="multiseason-models-as-hmms">Multiseason models as HMMs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multiseason-models-as-hmms"></a>
</h2>
<p>In <code>flocker</code>, we implement these models using a hidden
markov model (HMM) approach to dealing with the unobserved occupancy
state in each separate series. Calling our approach a HMM doesn’t
fundamentally change the model; it serves mainly to highlight the
connection between multiseason occupancy models and well-developed
techniques for efficiently computing the likelihood for a series.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The HMM
conceptualizes the latent occupancy state as a Markov-like process (the
process need not be strictly Markovian, because the transition
probabilities can vary by timestep), where the transition probabilities
between the two possible states (occupied or unoccupied) are a
colonization probability <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, an extinction probability
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>, and their complements
<span class="math inline">\(1 - \mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 - \mathcal{E}\)</span>. The complement of the
extinction probability turns out to be particularly important; we call
it the <em>persistence</em> probability <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P} = 1 - \mathcal{E}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To specify the HMM, we need a model for the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, a model for <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>, and a model for the initial
occupancy probability <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>
in the first timestep. We also need a model for the probability of
observing the data in any particular timestep conditional on the true
occupancy state in that timestep (in the HMM literature, this
probability is referred to as an <em>emission probability</em>).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="emission-probabilities">Emission probabilities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#emission-probabilities"></a>
</h4>
<p><em>Emission probabilities</em> are just fancy HMM terminology for
the most familiar part of multiseason occupancy model. They are the
probability of observing the data within a unit given the latent
occupancy state, and they depend only on the detection sub-model, which
is no different from a single-season detection sub-model. In
<code>flocker</code>, we assume that the logit-scale detection
probabilities vary according to a suite of covariates that can vary
across all levels of organization, including down to the visit level.
This is exactly the same way that <code>flocker</code> treats the
detection sub-model in a single-season model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="colonization-and-extinction">Colonization and extinction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#colonization-and-extinction"></a>
</h4>
<p>In “colonization-extinction” models, logit colonization probabilities
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and logit extinction
probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> are both
assumed to vary according to separate predictors based on covariates
that may vary across timesteps within series but never across visits
within closure-units.</p>
<p>In “autologistic” models, the occupancy probability in timestep <span class="math inline">\(t + 1\)</span> is assumed to depend on a suite of
site characteristics plus a term that depends on the latent true
occupancy state at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Some
treatments write the autologistic model in terms of an “occupancy
probability” that depends on covariates plus the “autologistic term”
that gets added on the logit scale when the site was previously
occupied. However, it is easier to understand this model in terms of its
colonization and extinction probabilities. In fact, the so-called
“occupancy probability” mentioned above is actually a colonization
probability, because it reflects the probability of occupancy
conditional on non-occupancy during the previous timestep. The
logit-scale sum of the colonization probability and the autologistic
term gives the probability of persistence <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, the autologistic model differs from the colonization-extinction
model in that it assumes that colonization and extinction probabilities
are related to one another via an offset that relates colonization to
persistence. If the offset is modeled as constant, then we can think of
this model as ascribing a “suitability” to each site that defines the
position of a pair of probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> that differ by a constant on
the logit scale. In practice, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is almost always larger than
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and so the offset is
positive.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard autologistic model that treats the offset
as a constant, <code>flocker</code> also affords the flexibility to
model the offset via its own covariate-based predictor, which
reintroduces flexibility in the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, but tends to retain the idea
that these probabilities ought to be related to one another and ought to
tend to move in tandem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="initial-occupancy">Initial occupancy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#initial-occupancy"></a>
</h4>
<p>Most examples of multiseason occupancy models in the literature
include an explicit model for the initial occupancy probability <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> via its own covariate-based
predictor, which is analogous to the occupancy predictor in a
single-season model. Thus, a colonization-extinction model would contain
predictors for detection, colonization, extinction, and initial
occupancy; an autologistic model would contain linear predictors for
detection, colonization, the colonization-persistence offset (often
modeled as a constant), and initial occupancy. <code>flocker</code> can
fit either model.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the HMM literature, <code>flocker</code> also comes
with optional functionality to handle <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> differently. Any pair of
time-invariant colonization and extinction probabilities defines an
equilibrium proportion of sites that are occupied. If colonization and
extinction remain constant for a long time prior to the first timestep,
the initial occupancy probability should simply be this equilibrium
frequency, eliminating the need to parameterize and fit initial
occupancy separately from colonization and extinction.
<code>flocker</code> is equipped to fit models without any separate
predictor for initial occupancy, and instead to begin with the
equilibrium frequencies implied by the colonization and extinction
probabilities modeled for the first timestep. Note that this approach is
sometimes valid even if the colonization and extinction probabilities
begin to vary during the timeseries being modeled, as long as they are
invariant for a substantial period up to and including the first year
modeled. As a concrete example, consider a study system that begins in
an equilibrium condition, but in which some sites burn in a forest fire
partway through the study. If the impact of the burn on colonization and
extinction probabilities is modeled adequately, then the modeled
probabilities prior to the burn will reflect the equilibrium
colonization and extinction probabilities in the pre-burn state. It is
for this reason that, when using equilibrium frequencies as initial
occupancy probabilities, <code>flocker</code> always computes the
equilibrium based on the probabilities modeled for the first
timestep.</p>
<p>As an aside, we somewhat regularly encounter confusion that conflates
initial occupancy probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> with colonization
probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. This
confusion apparently arises from the notion that the autologistic model
consists of a single-season occupancy model plus an autologistic term,
which leads people to incorrectly surmise that the linear predictor
without the autologistic term gives an occupancy probability. It does
not; it gives a colonization probability, which is typically much lower.
Any modeling exercise that enforces equality between initial occupancy
probabilities and subsequent colonization probabilities should be viewed
skeptically.</p>

<p>Let’s simulate some data that is valid for use with multiseason
models. Here, we will simulate data for three seasons with one unit
covariate and one event covariate. The data will be simulated under a
colonization-extinction model with explicit inits, but we will be able
to fit other models (autologistic, equilibrium inits) to the same
data.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

with a constant logit-scale offset separating colonization and

<li id="fn2"><p>It’s fine if some sites are surveyed for just one
timestep, but at least some sites are surveyed for multiple timesteps.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>For the curious, we use the forward algorithm to compute
the likelihood, and the forward-backward algorithm to compute unit-wise
posterior distributions for the latent occupancy state, and the
forward-filtering-backward-sampling algorithm to draw valid posterior
samples for the sequence of latent states<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>note that <code><a href="../reference/simulate_flocker_data.html">simulate_flocker_data()</a></code> can also
simulate directly from these other model types.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
